       This is going to be my favorite part of the app. The importance of poetry in Somali culture cannot be overstated.
       Poetry is not an art its an expectation of the language itself.
       I want us to learn some of the most famous poems in Somali history and recite them as part of our learning process.
       But also add our own from our own stories and experiences
