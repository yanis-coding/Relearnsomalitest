        We as a community must ensure we learn how to speak Somali.
       Heres an example of a fun quiz to make the learning process engaging and interactive.
       I will add many more types of quizzes as we move forward with the project.
       I may also add a head to head feature so you can compete with friends on who speaks the best Somali.
