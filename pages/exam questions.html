      <p>
        We as a community must ensure we learn how to speak Somali.
       This page will have exam questions to test your knowledge after going through the topics.
       Tis is where the real learning is coming to come from and really testing your Somali understanding.
       This will be added constantly and after you go through the vocab pages, do then do the multiple choice questions than move to these.
       This will be a real focus and im excited to build this out more.
