      <p>
        We as a community must ensure we learn how to speak Somali.
        Here's what the vocab page would look like. For every topic you will get a list of vocabulary words to learn.
        These will be important as all the topics will test you on these words and others.
        I could add flashcard features to help you learn these words better. Again, we will discuss this with founding members.
