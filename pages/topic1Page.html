      <p>
        We as a community must ensure we learn how to speak Somali.
       Here's how I think page 1 would look at after you choose the topic of "Friends and Family". 
       When I have my discussion with the founding members I can add more features and they can add.
       The current set i have are the speaking test, quizzes,written questions, and vocab pages.
       I may also add ai features to help with pronunciation and fluency but depends on if the foundering memeber want it
